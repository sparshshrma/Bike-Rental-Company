It was our First Semester JAVA code for a Bike Rental Company


Bike Rental Company

This program is designed for a Bike Rental Company to manage and handle their bike renting.
In the interface user is initially prompted some simple questions rel;ated to their trip.
The questions asked are like entering the file name in which all the bikes data is stored such as bike ID, battery and the rental status.
After that the user is prompted with four options if they want to rent, return, charge battery or exit from the application. 

When the customer chooses an option to rent, then there are some conditions that have to be met in the code otherwise the bike cannot be rented. 

When the customer chooses to return then the total cost is evaluated.

And lastly when customer chooses to exit then it closes the application.
